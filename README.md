This project simulates a zoo full of animals and how they interact with the 
zookeeper when given a certain command. We are assuming that the only animals 
in the zoo are a wolf, cat, feline, and a canine. We are also assuming that 
the print statement requirements apply to feline and canine as well as cat and 
wolf. We are assuming there is only one zookeeper. We are assuming that when the
cat is told to do something, it can only randomly choose between the 5 main 
functions of eating, sleeping, roaming, waking, and making noise. We are assuming that
when an animal is created that you are passing the name in.

Instructions to run code:
	From the same directory as the main.java file open the terminal. 
To compile, type: javac Main.java  
To run, type: java Main  
The code will then execute and print out proper statements.
